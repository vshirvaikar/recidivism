### ICPSR North Carolina Dataset

I. Read the dataset and pull out usable columns.

reader = file("/~/northcarolina1.txt", open = "r")
input = readLines(reader)
close(reader)
data = matrix(, nrow = 0, ncol = 28)
for(line in input){
  line = strtoi(strsplit(line, split = "")[[1]])
  if(line[28] != 3){
    data = rbind(data, line[1:28])
  }
}
reader = file("/~/northcarolina2.txt", open = "r")
input = readLines(reader)
close(reader)
for(line in input){
  line = strtoi(strsplit(line, split = "")[[1]])
  if(line[28] != 3){
    data = rbind(data, line[1:28])
  }
}
data[is.na(data)] = 0
priors = 10*data[,11] + data[,12]
school = 10*data[,13] + data[,14]
violations = 10*data[,15] + data[,16]
age = (100*data[,17] + 10*data[,18] + data[,19])/12
timeserved = (100*data[,20] + 10*data[,21] + data[,22])/12
alcohol = data[,2]
  # non-alcoholic = 0 and alcohol problem = 1
drugs = data[,3]
  # non-drug user = 0 and hard drug user = 1
release = data[,4]
  # unsupervised release = 0 and supervised parole = 1
married = data[,5]
  # unmarried = 0 and married = 1
degree = data[,6]
  # misdemeanor = 0 and felony = 1
gender = data[,10]
  # female = 0 and male = 1
type = data[,8]*2 + data[,9]
typeR = data[, 8:9]
colnames(typeR) = c("property", "person")
  # sets "other" as reference
recid = data[,25]

II. Compose the combined unsupervised (without recidivism) and supervised (with recidivism) datasets.

NCcluster = cbind.data.frame(priors, school, violations, age, timeserved, alcohol,
  drugs, release, married, degree, gender, type)
NCregress = cbind.data.frame(recid, priors, school, violations, age, timeserved, alcohol,
  drugs, release, married, degree, gender, typeR)

III. For the unsupervised dataset, normalize the numerical variables through division by the maximum value.

NCcluster$priors = NCcluster$priors/max(NCcluster$priors)
NCcluster$school = NCcluster$school/max(NCcluster$school)
NCcluster$violations = NCcluster$violations/max(NCcluster$violations)
NCcluster$age = NCcluster$age/max(NCcluster$age)
NCcluster$timeserved = NCcluster$timeserved/max(NCcluster$timeserved)

cluster = NCcluster
regress = NCregress
